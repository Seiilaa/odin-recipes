    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy-to-make curry is perfect for a weeknight dinner, offering a quick burst of aromatic flavor.</p> 
    <p>It combines tender chicken and fresh vegetables in a creamy, spice-infused coconut milk sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces.</li> 
      <li>2 tablespoons red curry paste (Thai-style is easiest).</li>
      <li>1 can (13.5 oz) full-fat coconut milk. </li>
      <li>1 cup frozen mixed vegetables (e.g., peppers and green beans)</li>
      <li>Cooked rice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sauté Chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the cubed chicken and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Add Paste: Reduce the heat to medium. Stir in the red curry paste and cook for 1 minute until fragrant, ensuring the chicken is coated.</li>
      <li>Simmer Sauce: Pour in the coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring to dissolve the paste.</li>
      <li>Add Vegetables: Add the frozen mixed vegetables. Continue to simmer uncovered for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender.</li>
      <li>Serve: Serve the curry hot over cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>
