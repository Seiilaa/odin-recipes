    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes.</p> 
    <p>Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or sautéed with butter and herbs. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes: Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.</li>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.</li> 
      <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.</li>
      <li>Salt: Kosher salt enhances the overall flavor. </li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil and drain the potatoes, then mash or pass through a ricer. </li>

      <li>Divide the dough into four even portions and shape into "snakes."</li>
      <li>Cut the snakes into pieces.</li>
      <li>Boil and drain the gnocchi.</li>
    </ol>
